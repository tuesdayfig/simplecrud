Why Docker

Docker, in this context, is useful because it packages all necessary components of a websever and allows it to be transferred to another user with minimumal effort. You can set up both the webserver and the HTTP code with one click. A guest OS within a VM is not needed here because it is set up to be able to run on any OS that the user is using.
