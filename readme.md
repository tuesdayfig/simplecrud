ADR Assignment (Michael Nygard template)

Status: Incomplete

Context: The goal of the webpage is to display a simple database on a webserver that allows for CRUD of each item in the database.

Decision: The code was pulled from a previous project that implimented an MVC model.

Consequences: It's now harder to change certain files in the project without affecting the other files due to a global DB variable.
