ADR Assignment 2

-Michael Nygard template

-The goal of the webpage is to create, read, update, and delete users from a database.

-The structure is based on the MVC model of programming. It's seperated out to keep each file as independent as possible. I've found it's worked best for my previous experiences in PHP and MySQL, which is what I've choosen to work with for this assignment.
