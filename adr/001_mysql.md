#Choice of DBMS

#Status: Incomplete

#Context: Assignment 2 for designing a simple database and run containers to display the database on a webserver.

#Decision: MySQL is a very common server for web applications and is already created in the Docker Hub. It's highly compatible with other OS, such as Linux and Mac. It's also what I'm most comfortable with. I'm using MySQL 5.7 to be compatible with my PHP code

#Consquences: Very versatile for different devices and OS and high speed queries.
